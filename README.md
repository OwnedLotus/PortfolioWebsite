# PortfolioWebsite
Website for my Portfolio

This is my portfolio website to show the projects that I am currently working on and have already finished working on. The final design of the website has yet to be finalized. 
As I continue working on projects, some will be created, some will be removed. 
This is all in relation to the Website. My GitHub Repository will continue to contain all uploaded projects.
As of now the link too the website has a problem that I have not figured out how to fix just yet.
Soon I will fix the link.
